# Helm Charts

## What is?
- The package manager for Kubernetes; Helm is the best way to find, share, and use software built for Kubernetes
- A tool for Kubernetes packages called charts
- A chart contains pre-configured Kubernetes resources such as ConfigMaps, Deployments , and StatefulSet manifests, PersistentVolumes , and editable settings for them
- As such, a chart may be seen as a bundle of resources that, if connected together, can create a complex Kubernetes deployment with multiple prerequisites
- Charts are the convenient way to tell the Kubernetes api-server which resources a given application needs to properly run in Kubernetes.

## Operations Supported:
- Creating new charts from scratch
- Packaging charts into chart archives
- Interacting with chart repositories (retrieving charts, adding new charts to repos etc.)
- Installing and deleting charts from an existing Kubernetes cluster
- Performing upgrades and rollbacks of charts
